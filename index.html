        <h3>Exit Spillovers of Foreign-invested Enterprises in Shenzhen’s Electronics Manufacturing Industry</h3>
        <p>
            Neighborhood characteristics have been broadly studied with different firm behaviors, e.g. birth, entry, expansion, and survival, except for firm exit. Using a novel dataset of foreign-invested enterprises operating in Shenzhen’s electronics manufacturing industry from 2017 to 2021, I investigate the spillover effects of firm exits on other firms in the vicinity, from both the industry group and the industry class level. Significant neighborhood effects are identified for the industry group level, but not the industry class level.

        <h3>Analysis of Proximity Informed User Behavior in a Global Online Social Network</h3>
        <p>
            Despite the earlier claim of "Death of Distance", recent studies revealed that geographical proximity still greatly influences link formation in online social networks. However, it is unclear how physical distances are intertwined with users’ online behaviors in a virtual world. I study the role of spatial dependence on a global online social network with a dyadic Logit model. Results show country- specific patterns for distance effect on probabilities to build connections. Effects are stronger when the possibility for two people to meet in person exists. Relative to weak ties, dependence on proximity is looser for strong social ties.

        <h3>The Impact of COVID-19 on Co-authorship and Economics Scholars’ Productivity</h3>
        <p>
            The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted traditional academic collaboration patterns, prompting a unique opportunity to analyze the influence of peer effects and coauthorship dynamics on research output. Using a novel dataset, this paper endeavors to make a first cut at investigating the role of peer effects on the productivity of economics scholars, measured by the number of publications, in both pre-pandemic and pandemic times. Results show that peer effect is significant for the pre-pandemic time but not for the pandemic time. The findings contribute to our understanding of how research collaboration influences knowledge production and may help guide policies aimed at fostering collaboration and enhancing research productivity in the academic community.
